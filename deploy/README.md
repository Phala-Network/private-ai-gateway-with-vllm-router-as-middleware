# Deploying Private AI Gateway Router Middleware With git-launcher

This directory contains the one-file dstack compose path for launching
Private AI Gateway through
[`git-launcher`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack-examples/tree/main/git-launcher).

The launcher fetches a pinned `private-ai-gateway` commit, verifies `HEAD`,
scrubs the checkout, preserves the container environment, and runs the gateway
repo's own [`../entrypoint.sh`](../entrypoint.sh). The launcher remains
generic; install, build, run, and ACI policy live in this repo.

The checked-in compose enables the built-in router middleware. The public ACI
frontend, cache-aware router middleware, and verified-provider backend run in
the same gateway process. The router reads the live upstream config and orders
candidates in-process; it does not start an external adapter, external vLLM
Router process, or `proxy_url` forwarding layer. See the
[configuration reference](../docs/configuration-reference.md#middleware).

## One-Command Deploy

The compose hard-codes the released launcher image:

```text
docker.io/dstacktee/git-launcher@sha256:4437dce18ec713b0991d34bd926d324966b1a0b90fad485b8ddb3f4ed2af138b
```

That digest comes from
[`git-launcher-v0.3.0`](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack-examples/releases/tag/git-launcher-v0.3.0).

Prepare an audited gateway commit, then run:

```bash
cd deploy
PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_REPO_COMMIT=<full-40-hex-sha> \
PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN=<long-random-admin-token> \
PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_MODEL=<public-model> \
phala-h4xuser deploy -n private-ai-gateway-router -c compose.yaml
```

For local/dev deploys, you can also copy
[`gateway.env.example`](./gateway.env.example), export those values from your
shell, and run the same `phala-h4xuser deploy` command. For production, pass
secrets such as admin tokens through the deployment secret mechanism rather
than keeping them in a plaintext env file.

`compose.yaml` inlines the launcher config, the static gateway config, and the
initial upstream config. dstack therefore measures the whole launch policy into
`compose_hash`.
After deployment, the gateway listens on port `8086`.

The gateway consumes two JSON files:

| File | Compose config | Runtime role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static gateway config | `gateway-config` | Startup policy: bind address, TLS certificate bindings, dstack endpoint, admin token, gateway state directory, and read-only seed paths. |
| Upstream seed config | `gateway-upstreams` seed copied to `<state_dir>/upstreams.json` on first boot | Initial provider/model routing policy. The live file is replaced by the admin API. |

The checked-in compose starts with an empty upstream seed:

```json
[]
```

For a real deployment, replace the `gateway-upstreams` `content:` block in
`compose.yaml` with the provider routes you want to boot with, or keep it
empty and set the config after boot through `PUT /v1/admin/upstreams`.
[`upstreams.example.json`](./upstreams.example.json) shows the current
three-provider shape.

## Ownership boundary

The launcher is build-system agnostic. It does not know this repo is Rust and
does not contain a Cargo install command. Its default-mode contract is:

1. Clone `REPO_URL`.
2. Check out exactly `COMMIT_SHA`.
3. Preserve the container environment.
4. Run `bash entrypoint.sh` from the pinned repo.

Everything after step 4 is gateway-owned:

| Concern | Owner | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workload source pin | Launcher config | `gateway-pin` in `compose.yaml` |
| Static gateway config | Deployment compose | `gateway-config` in `compose.yaml`, including the optional `middleware` section |
| Runtime bootstrap env | Deployment compose | service `environment:` in `compose.yaml` points at the static gateway config and cache directory |
| Initial upstream config | Deployment compose | `gateway-upstreams` in `compose.yaml` |
| Toolchain bootstrap | Gateway repo | `../entrypoint.sh` |
| Build and exec | Gateway repo | `../entrypoint.sh` |
| Downstream ACI frontend | Gateway binary | `../src` |
| Verified-provider backend | Gateway binary | `../src` |
| In-process router middleware | Gateway binary and config | Enabled in `gateway-config`; selects among configured upstream routes before the verified backend forward |

The public gateway repo root contains `entrypoint.sh`, so the launcher config
does not set `REPO_SUBDIR`.

## Volumes and Reboots

The compose uses two persistent volumes with different meanings:

| Volume | Mount | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gateway-checkout` | `/var/lib/git-launcher` | Source checkout cache owned by `git-launcher`. Scrubbed on every boot with `git reset --hard` and `git clean -ffdx`. |
| `gateway-state` | `/var/lib/private-ai-gateway` | Gateway-owned mutable state: active upstream config, attested-session log, and Rust build cache. |

Do not put gateway state or build artefacts under `WORK_DIR`. The source
checkout is allowed to disappear and reclone. By default `entrypoint.sh` stores
Cargo/Rustup/target state under
`PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CACHE_DIR=/var/lib/private-ai-gateway/cache`, so restarts
can reuse the toolchain and crate/build cache without making the source checkout
mutable.

## Gateway And Upstream Config

The complete config and environment-variable reference is
[`../docs/configuration-reference.md`](../docs/configuration-reference.md).

The static gateway config is mounted read-only:

```text
/etc/private-ai-gateway/gateway.config.json
```

It is selected by the only gateway config-path env variable in the compose:

```text
PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/private-ai-gateway/gateway.config.json
```

The gateway config names the writable state directory:

```text
/var/lib/private-ai-gateway
```

Inside that directory, the gateway owns `upstreams.json` and `sessions.jsonl`.
Operators do not configure those writable file paths individually.

The compose-mounted seed is read-only:

```text
/etc/private-ai-gateway/upstreams.seed.json
```

The state directory and seed path are configured inside `gateway-config`:

```json
{
  "state_dir": "/var/lib/private-ai-gateway",
  "upstream_config_seed_path": "/etc/private-ai-gateway/upstreams.seed.json"
}
```

### Multi-Domain Listener Usage

The compose keeps a single gateway listener on port `8086`. To serve multiple
public domains, configure DNS, TLS termination, SNI routing, and reverse proxying
outside this repo, and forward each public hostname to that listener with the
original HTTP `Host` intact.

Mount the leaf certificate used for each public hostname and list those
hostnames in the static gateway config:

```json
{
  "tls": {
    "domain_certificates": [
      {
        "domain": "api.example.com",
        "certificate_path": "/run/certs/api.pem"
      },
      {
        "domain": "chat.example.com",
        "certificate_path": "/run/certs/chat.pem"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When a client requests `/v1/attestation/report` through `chat.example.com`, the
gateway selects the `chat.example.com` certificate SPKI for
`attestation.evidence.downstream_tls_binding`. A request with an unknown `Host`
returns `404 not_found` instead of an attestation report.

At startup, if `<state_dir>/upstreams.json` is missing or whitespace-only, the
gateway validates the seed and copies it into that active config file. If the
active config already contains anything, the seed is ignored and the active
config wins. This lets a single compose boot a complete initial deployment
without blocking later admin updates.

Changing `gateway-upstreams` in a later compose revision does not overwrite an
existing active config volume. Use the admin API to replace the config, or
delete the `gateway-state` volume intentionally before redeploying.

The static gateway config, seed, and bootstrap env are part of the attested
compose. API keys in the seed and secrets interpolated into the static config
are therefore part of the deployment input and must be handled as secrets by
the deployment environment. For production, pass secrets through dstack
encrypted secrets, KMS, or mounted secret files rather than inline compose
values.

Source provenance is not set in the gateway config. The gateway reports the
`REPO_URL` and `COMMIT_SHA` from the git-launcher config, which is also covered
by the attested compose.

Example seed:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "tinfoil",
    "provider": "tinfoil",
    "base_url": "https://inference.tinfoil.sh",
    "models": {
      "kimi-k2": "kimi-k2-6"
    },
    "bearer_token": "<tinfoil-api-key>"
  }
]
```

Supported provider values are `openai-compatible`, `aci-service`, `tinfoil`,
`near-ai`, `chutes`, and `phala-direct`.

For `aci-service`, `base_url` is the HTTPS origin used for both model traffic and
`/v1/attestation/report`. The router fetches the report through normal TLS,
derives the attested TLS SPKI binding from that report, then pins that SPKI for
the actual upstream model request.

## Runtime Admin API

When `admin_token` is set in the static gateway config, the same active config
can be inspected and replaced:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8086/v1/admin/upstreams

curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @upstreams.json \
  http://127.0.0.1:8086/v1/admin/upstreams
```

The admin response redacts bearer tokens and returns the active config digest.

## Verification Surface

A verifier checks:

| Layer | What to compare |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher image | The image digest in the attested compose equals `sha256:4437dce18ec713b0991d34bd926d324966b1a0b90fad485b8ddb3f4ed2af138b` and verifies through the `git-launcher-v0.3.0` Sigstore provenance. |
| Launcher config | `REPO_URL` and `COMMIT_SHA` in `gateway-pin` match the audited gateway commit. |
| Gateway config | `gateway-config` matches the reviewed startup policy, including TLS certificate bindings, state directory, dstack endpoint, admin token, and read-only input paths. |
| Runtime env | Service `environment:` points at the reviewed gateway config and cache location. |
| Upstream seed | `gateway-upstreams` is the reviewed initial provider policy. |
| Gateway report | `/v1/attestation/report` binds the dstack KMS identity, ACI keyset, TLS SPKI if configured, and the git-launcher source provenance when present. |

The launcher image digest alone does not identify the workload; the compose
config is part of the trust surface.

## Toolchain Posture

The current `entrypoint.sh` can bootstrap Rust with apt + rustup inside the
TEE. That keeps the first deploy path simple, but it is a development-grade
trust surface.

The production target is a gateway-owned image that already contains the
Rust toolchain, or eventually the prebuilt gateway binary. The launcher still
does not own that toolchain; the image would be built and attested by this repo
and referenced by digest in `compose.yaml`.
