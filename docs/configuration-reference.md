# Configuration Reference

Private AI Gateway uses one read-only static config file and one writable state
directory. Operators must choose the config file with
`PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` and put gateway policy in that file.

## Runtime Files

| Item | Owner | Runtime path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static gateway config | Deployment | Required. Selected by `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH`. |
| Upstream seed config | Deployment | Selected by `upstream_config_seed_path` in the static gateway config. |
| Active upstream config | Gateway | `<state_dir>/upstreams.json` |
| Attested-session log | Gateway | `<state_dir>/sessions.jsonl` |

Operators configure `state_dir`, not the individual writable files inside it.
The gateway creates `state_dir` on startup, seeds `upstreams.json` from the
read-only upstream seed only when the active file is missing or empty, and
updates `upstreams.json` through `PUT /v1/admin/upstreams`.

Unknown fields in the static gateway config are rejected at startup.

## Minimal Config

This is the smallest practical container config.

```json
{
  "bind": "0.0.0.0:8086",
  "state_dir": "/var/lib/private-ai-gateway",
  "upstream_config_seed_path": "/etc/private-ai-gateway/upstreams.seed.json",
  "admin_token": "<long-random-admin-token>",
  "api_token": "<public-api-bearer-token>",
  "dstack_endpoint": "unix:/var/run/dstack.sock"
}
```

## Config Fields

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bind` | `127.0.0.1:8086` | Public HTTP listener address. Use `0.0.0.0:8086` in containers that expose the gateway port. |
| `state_dir` | `/var/lib/private-ai-gateway` | Gateway-owned writable state directory. The active upstream config and attested-session log are derived from this directory. |
| `upstream_config_seed_path` | unset | Read-only JSON seed copied to `<state_dir>/upstreams.json` only when the active upstream config is missing or empty. |
| `admin_token` | unset | Bearer token for `GET`, `PUT`, and `PATCH /v1/admin/upstreams`, plus `GET /v1/admin/router`. When unset, the admin API is not exposed. |
| `api_token` | unset | Optional bearer token for public inference, model catalog, metrics, and `/v1/upstream-status`. When unset, those routes are publicly reachable. |
| `dstack_endpoint` | dstack SDK default | dstack SDK endpoint, such as `unix:/var/run/dstack.sock`. |
| `direct_serving` | `false` | Set only when inference is served inside this same attested workload with no upstream hop. It is mutually exclusive with middleware mode. |
| `enable_e2ee` | `false` | Advertise and terminate ACI E2EE. The legacy dstack-vllm-proxy E2EE compatibility path remains available separately. |
| `middleware` | unset | Optional single-model router middleware. When present, the gateway orders configured upstream candidates locally, then forwards through the verified backend. See [Middleware](#middleware). |

## Middleware

The optional `middleware` section enables the built-in single-model router. The
router reads the live upstream config, orders candidate routes with cache
affinity plus PIG load/pressure signals, then forwards through the verified
backend. It is in-process and does not introduce an out-of-process router hop.
When the section is omitted the gateway serves the configured upstream directly.

| Field | Default | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `middleware.public_model` | derived | Public model id served by this router. If unset, the router derives it from enabled upstreams and requires exactly one public model. |
| `middleware.cache_threshold` | `0.30` | Minimum matched-prefix ratio needed before cache affinity can select a route. |
| `middleware.balance_abs_threshold` | `64` | Absolute load gap tolerated before a cache-matched route is rejected for being too loaded. |
| `middleware.balance_rel_threshold` | `1.50` | Relative load ratio tolerated before a cache-matched route is rejected for being too loaded. |
| `middleware.max_history_per_route` | `256` | Maximum routing-text history records kept per route in the process-local cache index. |
| `middleware.metrics_poll_ms` | `1000` | PIG metrics polling interval. `0` disables metrics polling and falls back to gateway-local in-flight counters. |
| `middleware.metrics_timeout_ms` | `800` | Per-upstream PIG metrics request timeout. |
| `middleware.metrics_stale_ms` | `3000` | Maximum age for a PIG metrics sample before it is treated as stale. |
| `middleware.metrics_path` | `/v1/metrics` | Metrics path on each upstream. |
| `middleware.trusted_user_tier_header` | `false` | Trust inbound `x-user-tier` for routing and forward it to PIG. Keep disabled unless a trusted front door strips or sets the header. |
| `middleware.default_engine` | unset | Optional default serving engine for OpenAI-compatible upstreams, such as `vllm` or `sglang`, used by request shaping. |
| `middleware.control_url` | unset | Optional control-plane URL for best-effort post-request usage reports only. Routing and catalog handling stay local. |
| `middleware.control_token` | unset | Bearer token sent to the optional control-plane usage-report endpoint. |
| `middleware.control_post_timeout_ms` | `10000` | Timeout for the fire-and-forget post-request usage report. |
| `middleware.pricing` | unset | Optional static pricing block used to inject `usage.cost` into client responses and usage reports. |
| `middleware.sse_keepalive_ms` | `10000` | Idle keep-alive interval for streaming responses; `0` disables the heartbeat. |

Request outcome observation is always on and needs no configuration. Requests
that reach the middleware completion path emit structured `request_outcome`
tracing lines for routing/shaping failures, upstream errors, stream failures,
client disconnects, and anomalous successful finish reasons. The `detail`
field is emitted only when the `request_outcome` target is enabled at `debug`.
Silence or re-route the target via `RUST_LOG` (the subscriber uses `EnvFilter`).

```json
{
  "middleware": {
    "public_model": "gemma4-31b-it",
    "default_engine": "vllm",
    "metrics_path": "/v1/metrics",
    "trusted_user_tier_header": true,
    "control_url": "https://control.example"
  }
}
```

No middleware field is strictly required, but production deployments normally
set `public_model`, `default_engine`, and `trusted_user_tier_header` explicitly.

## Source Provenance

Source provenance is not a gateway config field. The gateway reports source
provenance from the dstack git-launcher pin at
`/etc/git-launcher/gateway.conf`:

```text
REPO_URL=https://github.com/Phala-Network/private-ai-gateway-with-vllm-router-as-middleware.git
COMMIT_SHA=<audited-full-40-or-64-hex-commit-sha>
WORK_DIR=/var/lib/git-launcher/private-ai-gateway-router
```

When the launcher config is absent, source provenance is unknown and the
gateway omits `source_provenance` from attestation reports. Production
deployments should use `git-launcher`. The native ACI-service verifier checks
that `attestation.evidence.app_compose` hashes to the `compose-hash` event bound
into RTMR3. Binding the reported repository commit or image digest to reviewed
source remains a verifier-policy TODO.

The canonical attestation endpoint publishes the raw measured `app_compose`.
Never place plaintext tokens, API keys, or passwords in Compose. Use Phala
encrypted environment variables and leave only variable references in the
measured file. Their encrypted values are not published or bound by
`app_compose`.

If the launcher config exists, `COMMIT_SHA` must be a full 40- or 64-character
hexadecimal commit hash. Branch names, tags, and short hashes are rejected at
startup.

## TLS Binding

TLS binding is optional. Configure it only when clients verify the gateway's
public TLS certificate SPKI from the attested keyset.

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `tls.domain_certificates` | One mounted leaf certificate per public hostname. |

For multi-domain listening, use `tls.domain_certificates`:

```json
{
  "tls": {
    "domain_certificates": [
      {
        "domain": "api.example.com",
        "certificate_path": "/run/certs/api.pem"
      },
      {
        "domain": "chat.example.com",
        "certificate_path": "/run/certs/chat.pem"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Raw SPKI digest inputs are not supported. The gateway reads mounted leaf
certificates, computes `sha256(SPKI)`, and publishes those digests in the
attested keyset. When `tls.domain_certificates` is configured, the request
`Host` selects the matching downstream TLS binding for
`/v1/aci/attestation`. Unknown hosts return `404 not_found`.

## Upstream Config

The upstream seed file and active upstream database use the same JSON shape: an
array of upstream entries. The seed file is deployment-owned and read-only. The
active file at `<state_dir>/upstreams.json` is gateway-owned and is replaced by
the admin API.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "route-a",
    "provider": "aci-service",
    "base_url": "https://upstream-a.example",
    "models": {
      "public-model": "provider-model"
    },
    "accepted_subjects": ["app-id:0x<measured-app-id>"],
    "accepted_dstack_kms_root_public_keys": ["<kms-root-public-key>"]
  }
]
```

Supported `provider` values:

| Provider | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `openai-compatible` | Generic OpenAI-compatible upstream with no provider-owned verifier. |
| `aci-service` | ACI service that exposes dstack/DCAP evidence. |
| `tinfoil` | Tinfoil provider adapter. |
| `near-ai` | NEAR AI provider adapter. |
| `chutes` | Chutes provider adapter. |
| `secret-ai` | Direct SecretAI SecretVM origin with optional workload pinning; see [SecretAI verification](providers/secret-ai/verification.md). |
| `phala-direct` | Direct Phala dstack-vllm-proxy endpoint. |

Provider verification policy belongs on the upstream entry. For ACI service
routes, configure accepted keyset subjects, image digests, or dstack KMS
root public keys. For `aci-service` upstreams a subject anchors only in its
measured form — `app-id:0x<hex>` of the RTMR3-verified app id. The upstream
does not need to set a keyset `subject` of its own. For `secret-ai` the same
field pins measured SecretVM workload ids on that entry.

For `secret-ai`, `base_url` must be the root HTTPS inference origin. The optional
`accepted_subjects` field pins measured SecretVM workloads in this form:

```text
secretvm:<cpu-type>:<environment>:<template>:<artifacts-version>:sha256:<compose-sha256>
```

Without this field, the verifier still reconstructs and reports the exact
production workload, but does not assert that its serving software was
operator-approved. When pins are configured, a nonmatching workload fails
verification. TDX workloads must report DCAP status `UpToDate`. An SEV-SNP
origin must meet the componentwise AMD TCB minimum embedded in the verifier.

For `aci-service`, `base_url` is the HTTPS origin used for both model traffic and
`/v1/aci/attestation`. The router fetches the report through normal TLS,
derives the attested TLS SPKI binding from that report, then pins that SPKI for
the actual upstream model request.

## Environment Variables

The gateway runtime reads only these environment variables. Provider verifier
bridges may consume provider-specific environment variables such as
`DSTACK_VERIFIER_URL` or `PRIVATE_AI_VERIFIER_DIR`.

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` | Required. Selects the static gateway config file. |
| `RUST_LOG` | Tracing filter consumed by `tracing_subscriber`. |

Deployment tooling also uses these variables:

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CACHE_DIR` | `entrypoint.sh` build and toolchain cache root. Defaults to `/var/lib/private-ai-gateway/cache`. |
| `CARGO_HOME` | Optional override for Cargo cache. Defaults under `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CACHE_DIR`. |
| `RUSTUP_HOME` | Optional override for Rustup state. Defaults under `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CACHE_DIR`. |
| `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` | Optional override for Cargo build output. Defaults under `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_CACHE_DIR`. |
| `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_REPO_COMMIT` | Used by `deploy/compose.yaml` interpolation for the git-launcher `COMMIT_SHA` pin. |
| `PRIVATE_AI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` | Used by `deploy/compose.yaml` interpolation for the static config's `admin_token`. |
