// ── Canonical output schema (allowlist) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The client sees one shape regardless of which upstream served the request:
// only the fields this gateway documents as its output. A denylist can only
// remove what has been seen before and leaks anything new — an engine's next
// nonstandard field, a provider's verification blob, a trace event. An allowlist
// leaks nothing by construction: a field the schema does not name never reaches
// the client, whether or not we have seen it.
//
// This is why `rewrite_identity` no longer strips engine fields —
// `matched_stop` and its kind are simply not on the allowlist. Identity that is
// a *value*, not a field (`id`/`model`), is still rewritten there; the allowlist
// only decides which fields survive.
//
// Deliberately *not* included: `provider` (an aggregator that publishes which
// backend served a request emits this; we do not) and `system_fingerprint` (its
// whole purpose is to identify the serving backend configuration).

/// Every field the OpenAI chat-completion surface emits, by level. Cross-checked
/// against the documented OpenAI response and the common OpenAI-compatible
/// supersets of it. Extended only by a deliberate decision to support a new field,
/// never by what an upstream happens to send.
///
/// `reasoning*`/`thinking_blocks`/`reasoning_items` are reasoning extensions;
/// `audio`/`images` are multimodal outputs; `usage.cost`/`cost_details` are
/// injected by this gateway; `usage.reasoning_tokens` is a count some servers
/// report at the top of `usage`. The nested `*_tokens_details` objects are kept
/// whole so no token-breakdown sub-field is dropped.
///
/// `native_finish_reason` is intentionally absent: it duplicates `finish_reason`
/// with the upstream's raw value, and the standard schemas do not list it. A
